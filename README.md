## Optimizing your VB code even more

### Description

This article shows various speed increasing methods, I've done tests myself, you can see the performance difference in a graph and in a table.

This article is really worth your time.

For example, it shows how one simple "\" instead of "/" will speed up your app with more than 400% percent!

Something weird happened with the original tutorial. Probably because of the tables.
I don't like to do this, but I really had to upload this awesome article at my website:
